Overview
Preloaded for you in this Kata is a class Animal.
Task
Define the following classes that inherit from Animal.

I. Shark
The constructor function for Shark should accept 3 arguments in total in the following order: name, age, status. All sharks should have a leg count of 0 (since they obviously do not have any legs) and should have a species of "shark".

II. Cat
The constructor function for Cat should accept the same 3 arguments as with Shark: name, age, status. Cats should always have a leg count of 4 and a species of "cat".
Furthermore, the introduce/Introduce method for Cat should be identical to the original except there should be exactly 2 spaces and the words "Meow meow!" after the phrase. For example:

III. Dog
The Dog constructor should accept 4 arguments in the specified order: name, age, status, master. master is the name of the dog's master which will be a string. Furthermore, dogs should have 4 legs and a species of "dog".
Dogs have an identical introduce/Introduce method as any other animal, but they have their own method called greetMaster/GreetMaster which accepts no arguments and returns "Hello (insert_master_name_here)".
